Over the past two weeks, significant progress has been made on the authentication system and mobile navigation improvements. Three pull requests were successfully merged, including the implementation of OAuth2 authentication and mobile navigation bug fixes.

Currently, there are two open pull requests awaiting review: a user authentication feature that has been assigned to john.doe and jane.smith, and a mobile navigation fix that still needs reviewer assignment. The authentication feature appears to be a substantial addition requiring careful review.

**Action Items:**
- The mobile navigation PR needs reviewer assignment to move forward
- Consider prioritizing the authentication feature review given its complexity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub API Rate Limit**: The script respects GitHub's rate limits. If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again.

2. **Slack Permission Error**: Ensure your Slack bot has the correct permissions and is added to the target channel.

3. **Repository Access**: Make sure your GitHub token has access to all repositories you want to track.

4. **Channel ID Format**: Slack channel IDs should start with `C` (public channels) or `G` (private channels).

5. **Claude API Error**: If you get Claude API errors, make sure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits.

### Debug Mode

To see more detailed logs, you can run the script with Node.js debug flags:

```bash
DEBUG=* npm start open-prs
```
