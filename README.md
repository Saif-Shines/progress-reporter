## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **GitHub API Rate Limit**: The script respects GitHub's rate limits. If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again.

2. **Slack Permission Error**: Ensure your Slack bot has the correct permissions and is added to the target channel.

3. **Repository Access**: Make sure your GitHub token has access to all repositories you want to track.

4. **Channel ID Format**: Slack channel IDs should start with `C` (public channels) or `G` (private channels).

### Debug Mode

To see more detailed logs, you can run the script with Node.js debug flags:

```bash
DEBUG=* npm start open-prs
```
